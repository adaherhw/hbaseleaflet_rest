# hbaseleaflet_rest
Create a Web Project to access Hbase Via HBase REST API using Angularjs, bootstrap, jquery, OpenStreetMaps
## This demo demonstrates HBase utlizing REST API, angularjs, leafletjs, bootstrap


#### Demo overview

- The Data-Set Overview and Assumptions -
  - Data-set description -> http://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi/
  - Download NY City Freedon of Information Law (FOIL) data set from [here](http://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi/)
  - As described in the 'data-set description' (above), all personal Taxi data (Medallion and License) has been obfuscated.
  - The original data provided from the NY City cab data is aggregated per trip data, and does not provide second-by-second
     GPS details. 
  - However, for the sake of this project only, I provided few (only few) second-by-second GPS trips of my own, and
     inserted those into the Hbase trip table that I created for this project. This was done in order to augment the aggregate trip data with second-by-second GPS information.
  - The intent here is to demonstrate 'random access' of HBase using various GUI frameworks such as AngularJS, OpenMaps, Bootstrap, jqury, etc. 
  - It is not the intent of this project to  demonstrate the non-functional or administrative capabilities of HBase.
  - The data-set I am using in this demo is limited to 1000 rows only. 
  - There will be two projects one using the HBase REST API and the other will be using Phoenix;

##### Setup 

These setup steps are only needed first time

- Download HDP 2.3.2 sandbox VM image (Sandbox_HDP_2.3.2_VMware.ova) from [Hortonworks website](http://hortonworks.com/products/hortonworks-sandbox/#install)
- Import Sandbox_HDP_2.3.2_VMware.ova into VMWare and configure its memory size to be at least 8GB RAM 
- Find the IP address of the VM and add an entry into your machines hosts file e.g.
```
192.168.15.171 sandbox.hortonworks.com sandbox    
```
- Connect to the VM via SSH (password hadoop or whatever you set it to while installing the hortonworks sandbox)
```
ssh root@sandbox.hortonworks.com
```
- Pull latest code/sample documents and of HBase-leaflet
```
cd /root
git clone https://github.com/adaherhw/hbaseleaflet_phoenix.git
~/Hbase-leaflet/run_demo.sh
```
#step 1: start hbase in ambari
echo "make sure HBase is started"

#step 2: create hbase table, consisting of two Column Families (trip, fare); fare is not being used in these projects (as of now).
echo "creating hbase table"
hbase shell -n <<EOF
create_namespace 'trip_ns'
create 'trip_ns:trip_table', {NAME => 'trip', VERSIONS => 1}, {NAME => 'fare', VERSIONS => 1}
EOF

#step 3: insert hbase table
echo "insert hbase table"
awk 'BEGIN {FS=OFS=","} {print $1":"$6,$1,$2,$3,$4,$5,$6,$7,$8,$9,$10,$11,$12,$13,$14}' data/cars.csv > car_key.csv
hdfs dfs -mkdir /tripstaging
hdfs dfs -put car_key.csv /tripstaging

#step 3.5: build java project to generate jar and war files
echo "building java project"
ln -s /root/leaflet-hbase-rest/apache-ant-1.9.6/bin/ant /usr/bin/ant
cd leaflet-hbase-rest
ant clean build
cd ..

#step 4: insert trip route data and aggregate json in hbase table
echo "insert trip route data and and aggregate json in hbase table"
java -cp leaflet-hbase-rest/leaflet-hbase-rest.jar:/usr/hdp/current/hadoop-client/hadoop-common.jar:/usr/hdp/current/hadoop-client/hadoop-annotations.jar:/usr/hdp/current/hadoop-client/hadoop-auth.jar:/usr/hdp/current/hadoop-client/lib/*:/usr/hdp/current/hadoop-hdfs-client/hadoop-hdfs.jar:/usr/hdp/current/hbase-client/lib/* taxi.leaflet.HBaseInsertDetail

java -cp leaflet-hbase-rest/leaflet-hbase-rest.jar:/usr/hdp/current/hadoop-client/hadoop-common.jar:/usr/hdp/current/hadoop-client/hadoop-annotations.jar:/usr/hdp/current/hadoop-client/hadoop-auth.jar:/usr/hdp/current/hadoop-client/lib/*:/usr/hdp/current/hadoop-hdfs-client/hadoop-hdfs.jar:/usr/hdp/current/hbase-client/lib/* taxi.leaflet.HBaseInsertAggregate

#step 5: start hbase rest server
echo "start hbase rest server"
start-hbase-rest.sh

#step 6: start tomcat server at port 8086
#tomcat conf/server.xml has been modified
echo "start tomcat server at 8086"
start-tomcat.sh

#step 7: deploy java war to tomcat
echo "deploy java project to tomcat"
cp leaflet-hbase-rest/leaflet-hbase-rest.war apache-tomcat-7.0.67/webapps

echo "goto http://sandbox.hortonworks.com:8086/leaflet-hbase-rest/carmap.html"
echo "goto http://YOUR_OWN_SANBBOX_IP:8086/leaflet-hbase-rest/carmap.html"

#step 8: Enter a medallion in the input box, and click query button. The result will be displayed in the accordions.
echo "Below are some sample medallions:"
echo "171FD91CBF0D6FABF499A9452A4950D5"
echo "0B3D3D51C78E944F68DC04209E86D5F7"
